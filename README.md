# NERSA
time-of-use tariff definition
Anyone is free to make use of this tariff definition, applicable in South Africa.
5 days of the week, the WKD tariff applies, then there's a SAT and SUN table.
The JSON array is organised according to the hour-of-day, 0 to 23
The numbers 0,1,2 have the following meaning:
0 OFF-peak
1 standard tariff
2 Peak tariff
When NERSA makes changes, I'll do my best to update this table.
